## **Problem Statement**

My fitness tracker (name pending) will provide users with an easy way to keep track of their progress. My program will act as a gym journal and allow users to record their workout data. Users will have the ability to record what exercises theyâ€™ve done, what weight they used, the rep range, and/or the time they spent doing said exercise. Each entry will have a section for notes that users can refer back to if they choose to. The fitness tracker will have a date section users will fill out before they record any new data. This will allow users to have their data organized chronologically and further act as a journal. Users will be able to search previous entries by date and view the contents of that entry.

## **Proposed Architecture Overview**

## **API**
Models
```
// WorkoutModel 

Date date; 
String name;
String notes; 
```
```
// ExerciseModel

String exercise;
```
### **Get Workout Endpoint**
* Accepts `GET` request to `/workouts/:date`
* Accepts a Date and returns the corresponding WorkoutModel
  * If the user did not work out that day an empty workout will be returned

### **Create Workout Endpoint**
* Accepts `POST` request to `/workouts`
* Accepts data to create a new workout with a Date, provided name, exercise data, and an optional notes field.
* Workout name will be validated by checking for illegal characters. 
  * If the workout contains any invalid characters, will throw InvalidAttributeException

### **Update Workout Endpoint**
* Accepts `PUT` request to `/workouts/:date`
* Accepts data to update a previous workout including the updated workout name and notes

![Client sends the submit update form the Website Workout page. Website workout page sends an update request to UpdateWorkoutActivity. UpdateWorkoutActivity saves updates to the workout database. ](main/Update_Workout.puml)
