## **Problem Statement**

FitTrack will provide users with an easy way to keep track of their progress. My program will act as a gym journal and allow users to record their workout data. Users will have the ability to record what exercises theyâ€™ve done, what weight they used, the rep range, and/or the time they spent doing said exercise. Each entry will have a section for notes that users can refer back to if they choose to. The fitness tracker will record what date the workout entry was created. This will allow users to have their data organized chronologically and further act as a journal. Users will be able to search previous entries by date and view the contents of that entry.
